# ubuntu keyboard shortcuts

So I recently got a new macbook pro to use for work, and I was back on the good old thinkpad to do some hacking around when I stumbled upon some keyboard shortcuts that making with ubuntu much easier.

For this document I will refer to the super key aka meta key aka windows key (I guess the command key if you install ubuntu on a mac/ use a mac keyboard) as &lt;super&gt;.

really all you need to know is to hold down &lt;super&gt; to see a list of the shortcuts.

Check out the window shortcuts for sure.
